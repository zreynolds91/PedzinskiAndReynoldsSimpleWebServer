Availability tactics:
1.       Fault Detection: Exception Handling
3.       Fault Detection: Condition Monitoring done thread executer starts to block if over 200 threads are run simulatiously
4.       304 exception
Performance Tactics:
1.       Scheduling Policies: First in/first out done( the threadexecuter is this by default)
2.       Manage Resources: Introduce concurrency done ( already implemented and we chose to keep this, expanded on with ThreadPoolExecutor)
3.       304 exception
4.       Manage Resources: Bound Queue length or size to prevent overflow done ( threadexecuter)
Security:
1.       Detect Intrusion: will be the same as Exception handling
2.       Limit access: limit memory, network connections same as condition monitoring
3.       Maintain an audit trail
        4.    Limiting exposure
